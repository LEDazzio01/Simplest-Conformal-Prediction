# Simplest Conformal Prediction

Minimal, **builder‑first implementation of conformal prediction** — designed to make reliability guardrails in AI systems accessible, transparent, and easy to extend.

## ✨ Why This Repo Exists
Conformal prediction is a mathematically rigorous framework pioneered by Vladimir Vovk for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning. This repo distills the concept down to its **simplest working form**, so practitioners and recruiters alike can see:
- How uncertainty sets are constructed  
- Why conformal prediction matters for **Responsible AI**  
- How reliability can be embedded into everyday ML workflows  

## 🚀 Features
- **Minimal code footprint** — clear, readable Python implementation  
- **Step‑by‑step walkthroughs** — from data split to prediction sets  
- **Extensible design** — easy to adapt for classification, regression, or time series  

## 🌐 Applications
- **AI Safety & Reliability** — guardrails for high‑stakes predictions  
- **Security Environments** — uncertainty‑aware anomaly detection  
- **Forecasting & Time Series** — confidence sets for future values  

## 🧭 Intellectual Lineage
This project extends the lineage of **Vladimir Vovk’s conformal prediction** into modern Responsible AI practice, and the pragmatic instruction of my teacher **Valeriy Monokhin**, a leading promoter of conformal prediction in applied forecasting and time series (https://github.com/valeman/awesome-conformal-prediction). It demonstrates how reliability can be staged as a **portfolio artifact** — proof that engineering maturity and safety can coexist.
